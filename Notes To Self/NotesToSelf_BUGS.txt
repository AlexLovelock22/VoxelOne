Had a couple bugs - this is to document what the causes were and how they were fixed.

Chunks generating in front of the player - This was caused due to a difference in player coordinates and block coordinates - 
1 block equalling 2 player coordinates.

Crashes at higher render distances (12 -> 24) Not yet solved, but spent a long while trying to find the offender.
Was looking in the wrong script. Something important to do on crashes : 
Run the app, let it crash, dont check solely output, but also the Errors tab.
